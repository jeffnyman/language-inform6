This package permits syntax coloring of [Inform 6][i6] source code in the [Atom][] editor. This should also work with compatible syntax colorers, like TextMate 2, with some appropriate changes for the particulars of how grammar files are specified.

Note that this package does not deal with [Inform 7][i7]. Andrew Plotkin has already written an [Inform 7 language file][i7lang].

[i6]: https://github.com/DavidKinder/Inform6
[i7]: http://inform7.com/
[i7lang]: https://github.com/erkyrath/language-inform7
[atom]: https://atom.io/

This language extension correctly handles:

- Comments
- Strings (double and single)
- Directives
- Keywords
- Function definitions
